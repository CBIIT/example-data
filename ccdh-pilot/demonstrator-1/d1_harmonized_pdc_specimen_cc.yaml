  Title: PDC Specimen Example - Sept 2021 F2F Demonstrator 1
  Schema: ccdh.0713cc.Specimen
  Description:
    - "CRDC-H-compliant representation of the 'aggregate' PDC source data example described here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14lWLDD7iyJG0G57m6BgWYIeqrxK04P3qQRwxziqEz1A/edit#gid=0"
    - "**FOR EASIEST VIEWING TURN WORD WRAP OFF SO THAT COMMENTS DON'T RUN ONTO A NEW LINE**"
    - "In this example enumerated values are captured using a CodeableConcept object which bundles one or more Coding objects, each holding a single concept code and supporting metadata."

  Example:                                                        # type = Specimen

    identifier:                                                   # type = Identifier   (Identifier is a complex data type, but we are only showing a single field from this type)  
      - value: "tcga-coad:C3N-01648-08"                           # PDC.Sample.sample_submitter_id (specified here as a CURIE, where the prefix indicates the system that assigned it)
