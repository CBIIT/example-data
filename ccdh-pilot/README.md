This folder contains content created for the CCDH Pilot in September 2021.

It includes the two demonstrated developed for this Pilot as well as converters
that translate imported node data into the CRDC-H model as YAML, then validate
those transformed files using JSON Schema as well as LinkML Python data classes.
