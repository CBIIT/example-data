The LinkML can be used to [generate](https://github.com/linkml/linkml#python-dataclasses) [Python Data Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html), which can then be exported in JSON-LD, a JSON-based format used to represent RDF data."

    "\n",
    "Python Data Classes provide several useful features that we will demonstrate below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python Data Classes are generated automatically.** Rather than requiring additional effort to maintain a Python library for accessing the CCDH model, the [LinkML toolset](https://linkml.github.io/) can generate the Python Data Classes directly from the CCDH model, ensuring that users can always access the most recent version of the CCDH model programmatically. This also allows us to maintain Python Data Classes for accessing previous versions of the CCDH model, which we plan to use to implement [data migration between CCDH model versions](https://cancerdhc.github.io/ccdhmodel/latest/data-migration/)\n",
    "2. **Python Data Classes provide validation on creation.** As we will demonstrate below, creating a Python Data Class requires that all required attributes are filled in, and all fields are filled in the format or enumeration expected.\n",
    "3. **Easy to use in Python IDEs.** Since the generated Python Data Classes includes model documentation in Python, users using Python IDEs can see available options and documentation while writing their code."
