# Example data for the CCDH project

This repository is intended to act as a store of example data files from across
the [NCI Cancer Research Data Commons](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons)
nodes in a number of formats. Each directory represents a single dataset downloaded
from a node, and contains a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) documenting how
they were downloaded.
[CCDH](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons/center-cancer-data-harmonization-ccdh)
will use this example data to build and test the CRDC-H data model.
